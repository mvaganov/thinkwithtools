# Think With Tools: Augmenting Intelligence, Not Offloading It

> **Tagline:** *Learn to code webpages with AI as your partner--sharpening your mind, not offloading it.*

This course is about learning how to use Large Language Models (LLMs), not as a crutch, but as a partner in your own thinking. You'll build real webpages by hand, experiment with AI-generated code and design, and most importantly, practice the habits that help you stay in control of your ideas, goals, and creativity.  

In this course, you'll start with the basics of HTML and CSS, then move into projects where AI helps you brainstorm, compare, and refine ideas. You'll make a webpage about yourself, design a landing page for a product that doesn't exist, build a site reviewing AI tools, write a clear "how to" wiki, design an infographic, and finish with an interactive quiz. Along the way, you'll learn to ask better questions, critique what AI gives you, and spot when persuasion or manipulation is at work.

The class ends by stepping back to look at the bigger picture: the costs, tradeoffs, and ethics of our modern tech world. By the end, you'll have technical skills on display in a small protfolio of webpages, and a personal philosophy for how you want to use AI--so that it makes you sharper, not softer.

## Course Structure
The course is designed to be an 8 week course, with one-and-a-half to two hours of class meetings per week, and additional assigments outside of class meetings.

This course expects each student to use their own computer (or share with a peer), including access to the internet. Students will be expected to use a web browser for LLM access, a chat program or other LMS for peer communication, and possibly web-based tools for editing electronic artifacts (like images). Their computers must have user rights to write simple text files, or use other HTML editors.

Assignments given each week are expected to be done outside of class. Computers with keyboards and a mouse are recommended for the assignments.

  <summary>This document is a guideline written with humility, accepting that the course is still iterating.</summary><ul>
  <li> AI technology may advance quickly enough to obsolete the course before it is fully implemented in a class.
  <li> For an instructor to expect to teach this course well, they should have familiarity with design thinking, or other rapid prototyping experience.
  <li> Additional notes are included (behind summary expansions like this) by the author. These are to provide details, context, and some suggestions for specific in-class implementations.

## Course Skills
<details>
  <summary><b>Mental Habits:</b> metacognition, design thinking, skepticism, grit</summary><ul>
  <li> Metacognition: Do I understand the problem? What did I think I was asking the AI for? What do I think the AI thought I asked for? Is there something I need more clarity about to form a better question or better instruction?
  <li> Design Thinking: What are the goals to achieve? Can those goals be separated into other goals? What is the most important goal? How can I test if the goals are good? What can I try to achieve those goals? How can I test if our approach is good?
  <li> Skepticism & Critical Thinking: Is the AI telling me the truth? How can I test if it is true? Could my prompt be improved to make the AI more rigorous? Does this even make sense for me to ask? Does this make sense for me to do? Is the AI's suggestion actually good?
  <li> Grit: Is progress being made toward my goal? Is there a small goal I can achieve next? Can I adjust the goal to be more engaging? Can I adjust the webpage to be more engaging?</ul>
</details>
<details><summary><b>Prompt Engineering:</b> goal setting, intentional language, tool literacy, boundary setting</summary><ul>
  <li> Strong goal setting: What kinds of goals is the AI good at understanding? How can I identify a clear goal for the AI model? Does it help to identify what is not a goal? How can I use the AI tool to help me understand my own goal?
  <li> Intentional Language Use: What is the purpose I'm trying to convey? What do the individual words mean? How can I use the model to help refine the prompt?
  <li> Tool Literacy: What are the AI models? What can the models do? How do we use the models well? Are there non-LLM tools I can use to improve AI output?
  <li> Boundary Setting: What is not OK to ask the AI? Can companies sell what we write (and read) on the internet?</ul>
</details>
<details><summary><b>Iteration:</b> understanding technology, editing/creating artifacts, debugging</summary><ul>
  <li>Understanding Technology: What does this HTML code do? What is possible for HTML to do? How is HTML different from CSS, or JavaScript? How do I make a webpage on the internet? What is the internet?
  <li> Editing/Creating Artifacts: Can I edit HTML code, images, and other artifacts using non-AI tools? What tools can I use? How do I do that? Can AI help me learn to use the tools better?
  <li> Debugging: What is the problem? How do I solve it? How can I learn how to solve it? How can I understand the problem more clearly?
</ul></details>
<details><summary><b>Messaging:</b> persuasion, resilience against manipulation</summary><ul>
  <li> Pursuasion: What do I care about? What do other people care about? How can I make someone care about something? Where can I learn more about persuasive messaging?
  <li> Resilience: What are common messaging tactics that control attention? What messaging tactics work on me?
</ul></details>

## Major Assignments
<details><summary>Build webpages with AI by using metacognitively rich prompts. Use the critical literacy of Computer Programming to edit, critique, and improve AI output.</summary><ul>
<li> Assignments in this class are more like art projects than math assignments. Students should be encouraged to express themselves, and hold their work to a standard defined by the scrutiny of their peers. Suggestions for critique guidelines:<ul>
  <li> As a group, discuss the page categorically:<ul>
    <li> Vibe Check: How does it make you feel?
    <li> Design & Layout: Is the page balanced well? Is there a clear prupose to colors? Is the spacing and typography good? Is there a good visual hierarchy (what catches the eye first, and then what, and then what, ...)? Is the page cohesive?
    <li> Clarity & Communication: Can we tell what the page is trying to say? Are the ideas easy to grasp? Does the style fit the message?
    <li> Use of HTML/CSS Fundamentals: Does the structure make sense? Is it readable to make manual edits? 
    <li> Creativity and Personal Expression: Is the design original or unique? Were there any risks taken that paid off? Is there a notable style? Is there a point of view expressed?
    <li> Constructive Feedback: What is working well? What could be stronger? Concrete/specific suggestions? <i>Critique = Curiosity + Specificity + Kindness</i>
  </ul>
  <li> <b>Feel, Communicate, Improve</b>: Each student should give a 3 word critique for each other student. One word for <i>how the page feels</i>, one word for what that student recognizes <i>the page is communicating</i>, and one word for <i>what the page could improve</i> if it had to change one thing.
</ul>
<li> For each assignment, consider making this outline into a ruberic for grading, or a worksheet for students to fill out with each assignment:<br><ul>
  <li> Planning:<ol>
    <li> Explicit goals:
    <li> Prompt:
    <li> Extra Meaning:
    <li> Personal Goals:
    <li> Additional Questions:
    <li> Rough Sketch:
  </ol>
  <li> Implementation:<ul>
    <li> Quality of Results of Prompt Alone:
    <li> Quality of Results of Prompt & Extra Data:
    <li> Was the Writing the Extra Data Worth It:
  </ul>
</ul>
<li> Planning: preparation before interacting with your AI:<ol>
  <li> Identify your general goal for the assignment. Think about how you want to fulfill the requirements. Writing notes, diagrams, or mind-maps for yourself may improve your own clarity of thoughts.
  <li> Write a prompt that you think will generate what you want. Save this prompt, it will be used later.
  <li> Write down, in your own words, what you think this assignment is really asking for. Are there any important assumptions? Are there any non-obvious goals?
  <li> Write a your personal goal in doing this assignment if you have any, besides just fulfilling assignment requirements. Do you have any extra creative ambition? Could you use this output for another assignment?
  <li> Write down at least 3 questions to ask about this assignment. For example:<ul>
    <li> Do you know how to create the best picture possible to express your ideas? If not, ask about a good approach for selecting a picture.
    <li> Do you know the latest news about your topic? If not, ask if there is any important recent news about it.
    <li> Do you want an educated opinion about something related to your topic? If so, ask what you want the opinion about.
    <li> Do you know if a similar webpage already exists that you can be inspired by? If not, ask if there is such a page.
    <li> Do you want to know an interesting factoid about a related topic? If so, ask for an interesting factoid about a specific topic.
    <li> Do you know what it is about your topic that is most interesting or important to most people? If you don't, ask what is the most important or interesting thing about the topic.
    <li> Do you know the best way to express a specific message you want to share? If not, write your message and ask for alternative wording.
    <li> ... you can ask an LLM to provide more example questions if you need more questions.
  </ul>
  <li> Draw an outline of the web page you want to meet the assignment. There are multiple ways you could do this:<ul>
    <li> Use a physical paper with a pen or pencil to sketch boxes for each area of your webpage, and label what each box is for. Take a digital picture of this sketch, with a cell phone or laptop webcam.
    <li> Draw a picture using a simple graphics program, like MSPaint on Windows.
    <li> Use text boxes in a word processor or presentation software and then take a screenshot.
  </ul>
</ol>
<li> Implementation: After preparation steps:<ul>
  <li> Imagine what you expect the AI to do. You don't need to write this down, but writing it can help your thought process.<ul>
    <li> What kind of thing will it say?
    <li> What questions will it answer?
    <li> Will it seemingly ignore any part of your prompt?
  </ul>
  <li> Give the LLM your prompt from step 2. Evaluate the LLM's output<ul>
    <li> Is it good?
    <li> Does it do everything you want?
  </ul>
  <li> Consider the preparation work you did before sharing the prompt with the LLM. In a new AI window, give the background information from step 3, your goal(s) from step 4, and the questions you wrote for step 5. Also, take the picture of your outline from step 6 and feed that image into the LLM. After providing all of this input, give it your prompt from step 2 (or a modified version of that prompt if it seems appropriate). Evaluate the output.
  <li> Compare the output from the first prompt that didn't contain any of your other thoughts or goals to the second prompt that did. Was the different output worth the extra effort?
</ul>
<li> Be prepared to share your prompts and the LLM's webpage results with the class during the next class meeting. Each assignment may have additional asks which you should also be prepared for during your brief presentation.
<li> Edit the generated HTML or CSS to tweak the results. Feel free to ask the LLM to make the changes for you, or for syntax help so you can change things yourself.

# Curriculum

## Section 1: Web Foundations and Metacognition
<!-- ~60-110 min -->
<details><summary>Learn basic HTML by hand</summary><ul>
<li> <i>(5 min)</i> Introduce the importancs of web programming. "Web development with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is critical literacy in this course. It is true that by the end of the class, the AI will be writing most of your code. However, it is an inescapable fact that these technical skills are required to edit, critique, and improve AI output. web programming is not mechanics that can be ignored, it is the source of your most powerful agency when doing web development."<br>
"We are going to write HTML by hand, so that you can get a feel for the technology, and understand the output that LLMs give us."
<li> <i>(2 min)</i> Have each student create a plain text file, with a <code>.html</code> suffix
<li> <i>(30 min)</i> Write "Hello World! This is my first HTML webpage." Starting from scratch, from an empty file with some understandable text, add HTML tags one at a time. This will give students clarity about how to program, and dispel some ambiguity about what code does. Make predicitons about output and test those predictions often, so that students can recognize and get into that habit as well.<ul>
<li> Use <code>b</code>old, <code>i</code>talics, <code>u</code>nderline, and <code>strike</code> tags to change the appearance of words written in the page.
<li> Add an image. show how the <code>img</code> tag works (<code>src</code> and <code>with</code> or <code>height</code> variables)
<li> Show how the <code>a</code>nchor tag works (<code>href</code> to google.com, or some other safe website)
<li> Show <code>p</code>, <code>br</code>, <code>h1</code>, <code>h2</code>, <code>h3</code> tags
<li> Look at each student's work as they follow along with your tutorial.
</ul>
</ul></details>
<details><summary>Compare your work to AI-generated code</summary><ul>
<li> <i>(2 min)</i> Ask each student to "imagine what is the simplest HTML webpage you can make." Have them describe their expectation to a peer.
<li> <i>(2 min)</i> Have each student prompt an LLM "What's the simplest HTML webpage you can make?" How was it different from expectations?
<li> <i>(2 min)</i> Ask an LLM to list the basic HTML tags used for formatting, with an example of synta using each tag, and expected output.
</ul></details>
<details><summary>Discuss AI Output: What did you get?</summary><ul>
<li> <i>(10 min)</i> Discuss: Did it explain it's thinking? Did the LLM output more HTML syntax than you expected? Or less?
<li> <i>(5-40 min)</i> Try a different LLM and see if the results are different. Here are the best LLMs as of the writing of this document: <a href="https://chatgpt.com/">ChatGPT</a>, <a href="https://claude.ai/">Claude</a>, <a href="https://deepseek.ai/">Deepseek</a>, <a href="https://gemini.google.com/">Gemini</a>, <a href="https://grok.com/">Grok</a>. Encourage students to try each one at some point during the class. Because of the rate of change in the AI industry, expect this list of recommended LLMs to change during the class. Be prepared to research a better list before class starts.
<li> <i>(2 min)</i> Using a chat program or LMS that the entire class has access to, have each student cut-and-paste their favorite sentence generated by an LLM from today's exercises.
</ul></details>
<details><summary><b>Assignment:</b> About Me Page</summary><ul>
<li> Write your name in a simple webpage. Add personal information about yourself that you want people to know. Consider what you think is important to you, and what is important for other people to know about you.
<li> Use at least 3 different tags (for example: <code>h1</code> for a title, <code>b</code> to make important text bold, <code>img</code> to include an image you think is important).
<li> When you were writing the HTML code, did you imagine what the output would look like? did the output come out like you expected?
<li> Paste your HTML code into an LLM and ask it to make changes to it. For example "take this webpage and make it look like a modern blog post". Look at the HTML output.
<li> Be sure to NOT include too much personal information. It is possible for LLMs to leak data, and this information could be used for identity theft in the future.<ul>
  <li> Avoid sharing your real name, address, phone number, email address, birthdate, middle name, what school you are attending, the names of your pets, names of family members
  <li> NEVER share passwords, PINs, passport/drivers-license/social-security numbers, bank acount numbers, or any other unique numbers associated with your identity.
</ul>
</ul></details>

## Section 2: Web Style and Iteration
<!-- ~60-120 min -->
<details><summary>Review About Me Page</summary><ul>
<li> <i>(5-30 min)</i> Each student should briefly show their personal webpage, and answer any questions the teacher or other students might have about it.
</ul></details>
<details><summary>Learn CSS and layout with <code>&lt;div></code></summary><ul>
<li> <i>(20 min)</i> Write all of the CSS exaple code below, incrementally, from an empty .html file. Just as before, start from scratch, and test expectations often.<ul>
<li> Students should write the same code as you. Ask them to speak up if their output looks incorrect. It is critical that students have a strong baseline of understanding how typed syntax creates web artifacts.
<li> Start with the body, without any CSS classes defined. View the webpage.
<li> Add the CSS classes one at a time, viewing the webpage between each addition.<br><code>
&lt;body><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;h1>Confucius said:&lt;/h1><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;p><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If your plan is one year, &lt;span class="bluetxt">plant rice&lt;/span>.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If your plan is ten years, &lt;span class="greentxt">plant trees&lt;/span>.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If your plan is one hundred years, &lt;span class="redtxt">educate children&lt;/span>.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/p><br>
&lt;/body><br>
&lt;style type="text/css"><br>
h1 {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;font-family: courier, courier-new, consolas, serif;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;font-size: 20pt;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;color: blue;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;border-bottom: 2px dotted blue;<br>
}<br>

.redtxt { color : #FF0000; }<br>
.greentxt { color : #0f0; }<br>
.bluetxt { color : blue; }<br>
&lt;/style><br>
</code>
</ul>
<li> <i>(20 min)</i> Teach basic Div tags. Use a similar approach to the one for CSS (start with basic HTML first, view result, add classes incrementally while refreshing to check results). Use the following code (or something similar):<br><code>
&lt;head><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;title>Web Development Haiku&lt;/title><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;style type="text/css"><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.footer { border: 2px dotted; border-color: #44f; color: #44f; padding: 5px; text-align: right; }<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.content { border: 1px solid; background-color: white; margin: 10px; padding: 2px; }<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.title_area { background-color: black; font-size: 200%; text-align: center; color: #aaf; }<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.container { background-color: #aaf; padding: 20px; width: 400; }<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.main_image {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;width: 300; height: 200; background-repeat: no-repeat;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;background-image: url(https://nickelodeonuniverse.com/wp-content/uploads/Spongebob.png)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/style><br>
&lt;/head><br>
&lt;body style="background-color: #ffffdd;"><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;div class="container"><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;div class="title_area">iStruggle&lt;/div><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;div class="main_image">&lt;/div><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;div class="content"><br>
This is my webpage&lt;br><br>
I write whatever I want&lt;br><br>
But, does it work yet?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/div><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;div class="footer">if you can read this, my HTML works.&lt;/div><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/div><br>
&lt;/body></code>
</ul></details>
<details><summary>Hosting images online</summary><ul>
<li> <i>(2-40 min)</i> Show the class how to host an image on the internet in a way that is accessible to your teaching environment (some image sharing websites might be blocked). <a href="https://uploadcare.com/pricing/">uploadcare</a> or <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site">github</a> might be appropriate. Prepare this before class starts; technical difficulties can arise in practice. If your web traffic is filtered by strict school policies, use an LLM to try to find workarounds.
</ul></details>
<details><summary>Experiment with AI restyling your page in multiple visual themes.</summary><ul>
<li> <i>(3 min)</i> Cut and paste the HTML page into an LLM. ask the LLM how to modify it for different results (like left-alignment of the title, or different colors)
<li> <i>(2 min)</i> Ask the LLM to restyle your page in at least 3 different styles (for example: minimalist, retro, neon). For example: "Restyle this page to have a minimalist aesthetic"
<li> <i>(2 min)</i> Using a chat program or LMS that the entire class has access to, have each student cut-and-paste their favorite sentence generated by an LLM from today's exercises.
</ul></details>
<details><summary><b>Assignment:</b> About Me Card (stylized character card)</summary><ul>
<li> Create a character card about yourself, like those used in games. Include a picture and some information about yourself.
<li> Consider what is the most important thing about you that people should know. Do you have a passion? Do you have a skill you want to be known by? What reputation do you want the world to have about you?
<li> Feel free to use content from your previous assignment.
<li> You can use the last 'div' example as a starting point for a design/structure.
</ul></details>

---

## Section 3: AI as an Idea Generator
<!-- ~66-91 min -->
<details><summary>Review About Me Card</summary><ul>
<li> <i>(5 min)</i> Pair up, and explain your character card to one other student. Why did you choose that image? Why did you write that text?
<li> <i>(15 min)</i> The class should reconvene after a short time for group discussion, and each student should briefly show their character card to the entire class. Students should be ready to answer any questions about their work.
</ul></details>
<details><summary>Learn tables in HTML</summary><ul>
  <li> <i>(15 min)</i> Teach basic HTML tables. You can use a similar approach to the one for CSS, with the following code (or something similar):<code><br>
&lt;table><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;tr><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;th>First&lt;/th>&lt;th>Last&lt;/th>&lt;th>First Company&lt;/th><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/tr>&lt;tr><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;td>Bill&lt;/td>&lt;td>Gates&lt;/td>&lt;td>Traff-O-Data&lt;/td><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/tr>&lt;tr><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;td>Steve&lt;/td>&lt;td>Jobs&lt;/td>&lt;td>"blue box"&lt;/td><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/tr><br>
&lt;/table><br>
&lt;style type="text/css"><br>
table { border: 1px solid #f00; border-spacing: 5px; }<br>
td { border: 1px solid black; padding: 10px; }<br>
th { border: 5px dotted #0ff; padding: 0px; }<br>
&lt;/style><br>
  </code>
</ul></details>
<details><summary>Use AI to brainstorm "10 everyday frustrations" --> filter ideas together</summary><ul>
<li> <i>(10-20 min)</i> Prompt: List 10 everyday frustrations people have that could inspire a product.<ul>
  <li> Have different students generate the list with different LLMs. Determine with the class what the most compelling ideas are.
  <li> Did the LLMs miss any important frustrations that the students are focused on?
  <li> Pick a topic with students, possibly from the list of frustrations.
</ul>
<li> <i>(10-20 min)</i> Prompt: Create a table of possible new product solutions to [insert frustrating problem description here]. For each new solution, identify practical use (does the new product solve the problem), practical feasibility (could the new product actually be created) and financial feasibility (could this new product be produced cheaply).<ul>
<li> Impractical and expensive products are not bad output, this is an exercise to judge the AI's brainstorming and evaluation.
<li> Show how to use AI image generators to create placeholder images of new products.
<li> Show how to feed sketches into image generators to make product images with specific details.
</ul>
</ul></details>
<details><summary>Discuss divergent thinking vs. convergent filtering</summary><ul>
<li> <i>(2 min)</i> Identify that as you have been reading lists and tables generated by AI, you have been evaluating which ideas are nonsense, and which are promising.
<li> <i>(2 min)</i> Identify how the AI is being used for Divergent Thinking (generating different ideas), and your human intuition is being used for Convergent Filtering (recognizing signal in the LLMs' noise).
<li> <i>(5-10 min)</i> Discuss: Were there any ideas that seem like no person could have thought of them? Did the LLM provide an real "creative" value? Did it do much more than organize thoughts? Is organizing thoughts enough value to justify the time cost of using AI for brainstorming? Imagine 2 different teams: one that uses AI for brainstorming, and one that doesn't. Which team will have more ideas? Which team will be able to implement their ideas better?
<li> <i>(2 min)</i> Have each student cut-and-paste what they think the worst idea is that the AI generated from today.
</ul></details>
<details><summary><b>Assignment:</b> Products That Don't Exist (fake product landing page)</summary><ul>
<li> Create a landing page for a new product that doesn't yet exist. Include images, and text descriptions of the product. Try to make a product that people will want to buy. It's ok if you don't know how to create it, or if the product is impractical.
<li> Before starting the assignment, ask students to:<ul>
  <li> Use AI to generate product ideas.
  <li> Consider: could you come up with a better ideas by combining ideas that the AI listed?
  <li> After selecting a product to make your page about, ask a peer student or the teacher for their thoughts about your idea.
  <li> You will be asked to present your product. During your presentation, be ready to identify at least one thing you removed/replaced from the LLMs generated output.
</ul>
</ul></details>

---

## Section 4: Trust, Persuasion, and AI Reviews
<!-- ~84-104 min -->
<details><summary>Review Products That Don't Exist</summary><ul>
<li> <i>(2 min)</i> Before reviewing assignments from the previous class, ask the students to make note of what is inspiring or pusuasive about the web pages. Also ask them to be ready to explain what they removed/replaced from the LLM generated content.
<li> <i>(20 min)</i> Review the pages with students, asking each one about how they altered the LLM output. After the review, discuss what the most pursuasive and inspiring things about the pages. Did the AI output surprise anyone?
</ul></details>
<details><summary>Use AI to generate fake review sites (good/bad reviews)</summary><ul>
<li> <i>(20 min)</i> In class exercise: Have an LLM generate a fake reviews site with fake reveiws, possibly for a class favorite from the Products That Don't Exist. Have the LLM include good reviews and bad reviews.
<li> <i>(2 min)</i> share the most extreme review written by an LLM.
</ul></details>
<details><summary>Discuss trustworthiness and patterns in reviews</summary><ul>
<li> <i>(15 min)</i> Discuss any patterns you can recognize in the reviews. Which reviews seem the most trustworthy? Does everyone in class have the same opinions?
</ul></details>
<details><summary>Meta-exercise: AI reviewing AI reviews</summary><ul>
<li> <i>(5 min)</i> Have the AI review a product based on the reviews of other AI. Is the most recent AI review (the one based on other AI reviews) strange at all? Is there anything factually wrong in the latest review when compared to the original product?
</ul></details>
<details><summary>How to do convergent filtering with images</summary><ul>
<li> <i>(20-40 min)</i> <a href="https://www.photopea.com/">Photoshop tools</a> can combine and manipulate images. Using AI tools, you can create AI generated image parts, and arrange them in a collage, using different layers and effects. Show students how to generate a few images, and combine precisely using photoshop-like software. Prepare this before class starts, including some prepared images. This exercise can rapidly get derailed by technical challenges and internet slowdowns.

## Section 5: Clarity and Knowledge Representation
<!-- ~95 min -->
<details><summary>Review Reviewing the Reviewers</summary><ul>
  <li> <i>(25 min)</i> Share review sites as a class. Have each student identify which AI tool got the best reviews on their review site. Ask each student "Which review seems the most credible?" Did anything about the AI output surprise anyone?
</ul></details>
<details><summary>Ask AI for step-by-step instructions (simple and complex)</summary><ul>
<li> <i>(20 min)</i> Ask the AI how to do something "simple", and provide step by step instructions. For example: "give me instructions for how to make a peanutbutter sandwich". Discuss the results.<ul>
<li> What did you ask instructions about? Is everything correct?
<li> Did the AI miss anything?
</ul>
</ul></details>
<details><summary>Compare AI steps to human knowledge</summary><ul>
<li> <i>(10 min)</i> Ask the AI how to do something more specific that you know how to do, like defeat a winning strategy for your favorite game. If you don't know what to ask, ask the LLM to provide a list of topics that an average human is probably much more knowledgable about than an LLM.
</ul></details>
<details><summary>Discuss what's missing, unclear, or misleading</summary><ul>
<li> <i>(20 min)</i> Discuss with the class what kinds of things AI seems to be bad at knowing. Compare it to what AI seems to be good at knowing. Try to define what is missing. Is there a common theme? Is there a missing perspective? Is there a kind of information that could be helpful but is absent?
<li> <i>(20 min)</i> Explain <a href="https://youtu.be/OXICDUqaz5w">Word Vectorization</a>, which provides a foundation to explaining why AI is good at working with ideas as words, and not with real experiences.<ul>
  <li> TODO simple quiz questions to test if students are paying attention. Possibly structure the quiz questions to prompt students to think about how they create meaning and values in their own lives.
</ul>
</ul></details>
<details><summary><b>Assignment:</b> How To Wiki (a peer should be able to follow it)</summary><ul>
<li> Build a simple wiki-style site explaining how to do something you know well. A peer classmate should be able to follow the instructions.
<li> Make sure you edit the instructions generated by the LLM so that they are more accurate, and be prepared to explain some of those details to the class.</ul></details>

## Section 6: Persuasion in Visual Form
<!-- ~120 min -->
<details><summary>Exchange How To Wikis and test them on each other</summary><ul>
<li> <i>(20 min)</i> Each student should pick a peer, and trade How To Wikis with each other. Pair up, and try to do your partner's tutorial
<li> <i>(10 min)</i> After some time doing your peer's tutorial tutorial (or struggling to do it) identify unclear steps, or missing steps. Also, each student should explain to their partner what part of the LLM output they modified.
<li> <i>(20 min)</i> Reconvene as a class to discuss what pain points there were in making instructions for people, and following instructions from other people.</ul></details>
<details><summary>Learn principles of persuasive infographic design</summary><ul>
<li> <i>(20 min)</i> Ask the class what is exciting or curious to them in the world today, and think about how to represent it visually.<ul>
<li> Prompt: What is one surprising fact about [topic you're curious about] that would make a good infographic?
<li> Have students think of an iconic image associated with their idea for an infographic.
<li>Brainstorm ways to turn that icon into something meaningful in an infographic. Ask an AI for ideas.
</ul>
<li> <i>(20 min)</i> Discuss what emotions (or biases) will make the message of this inforgraphic more appealing, surprising, or otherwise engaging? Consider prompting an AI about this topic before teaching the class:<br><code>What are some general guidelines for how to make an appealing infographic? What elements are highly attractive and persuasive to include or emphasize? If there are well known broad concepts or general rules that can be applied as heuristics to infographic persuasiveness, make a note of those.</code>
</ul></details>
<details><summary>Sketch first, then use AI for layout and visuals</summary><ul>
<li> <i>(20 min)</i> Sketch the infographic's structure on paper, labeling what goes where, before AI design help. Take a picture with a digital camera so you can upload it to your LLM. Note that this might take longer than expected, because not all students will have paper and writing implements on hand. If students are confused about what an infographic should look like, recommend that they search for some infographics online, and emulate one that they like. Also remind them that practicing creativity in small ways now is required to practice creativity in more meaningful ways later.
</ul></details>
<details><summary>Basic fact checking</summary><ul>
<li> <i>(10 min)</i> Create an outlandish numerical claims for an infographic (like: "99% of Americans believe AI is going to make their job obsolete"). Ask the LLM to determine if the numerial claim is accurate, and how to determine the accuracy of a statement like that.
</ul></details>
<details><summary><b>Assignment:</b> Infographic</summary><ul>
<li> Use HTML, CSS, and at least one generated image to create an infographic that explains a topic of interest.
<li> Fact check numerical details in the infographic, and use LLMs to verify your facts. Be prepared to discuss these facts, and the fact-checking techniques you used, when presenting your infographic in class. Have your sources documented and ready to share.
</ul></details>

## Section 7: Interactivity, Engagement, and Ethics
<!-- ~70-95 min -->
<details><summary>Review Infographics</summary><ul>
  <li> <i>(20 min)</i> Before reviewing, ask the students to make note of what is inspiring or pusuasive about the pages. Each student should share their infographics with the class, including references to sources where data came from. As a class, discuss what the most pursuasive and inspiring thing was the infographics. Did the data surprise anyone? Did the AI output surprise anyone?</ul></details>
<details><summary>Webpage hosting</summary><ul>
  <li> <i>(10-30 min)</i> Show the class how to host webpages on the internet. <a gref="https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site">Github</a> is a reliable host for simple web pages. There are almost certainly others as well. Use an LLM to determine if there is an easier method for students to have their webpages hosted</ul></details>
<details><summary>Generate viral-style quizzes with AI</summary><ul>
  <li> <i>(5 min)</i> Come up with an idea for a viral quiz. Something like "what fruit are you?" or "What Spongebob character is your spirit animal?" Ask your LLM for topic ideas after you come up with a few.
  <li> <i>(5 min)</i> Have the AI generate the quiz as an example. Show the JavaScript elements present in the quiz.</ul></details>
<details><summary>Add a hidden agenda (e.g., guess income level, or something else)</summary><ul>
<li> <i>(5 min)</i> Identify a hidden agenda to add to the quiz. For example: "Rewrite the quiz so it will also help identify the income level of quiz takers."<br> Instead of income level, you can try: Age, Gender, Political Affiliation, Education Level, Occupation, Relationship Status, Physical Health, Mental Health, Risk Tolerance, Brand Affiliation, Home Ownership Status, Voting Liklihood, Privacy Attitudes, Persuadability, Moral Foundations, Patience, Addictions, Cognitive Style, Social Network Density, ...</ul></details>
<details><summary>Discuss how engagement --> personal data --> business models</summary><ul>
<li> <i>(10 min)</i> Ask the AI to help you come up with tricks to make the quiz more engaging, to drive more interaction from users. Brainstorm with your AI how to create a click-baity title or tagline for a quiz. Implement those tricks.
<li> <i>(5-20 min)</i> Discuss with the class: user interaction can be processed to recognize valuable personal data about quiz takers, which can then be bought and sold online. Companies like Google and Meta are extremely profitable because of this kind of data trade. Who would want to buy this kind of data, and why?
</ul></details>
<details><summary><b>Assignment:</b> Interactive Quiz</summary><ul>
<li> Make a JS-powered quiz like "What Type of Plant Are You?" or "Can You Survive in the Wild?"
<li> Make sure the quiz has a clear title. Write a description of the quiz in one or two sentences. Also, consider creating an image to summarize the quiz.
<li> Optionally, generate quiz questions that have a specific agenda for sorting quiz takers.
<li> Each quiz quesition and its answers should be checked, and modified to the student's preferences. Also, it might be helpful to ask the LLM why it phrased a question or answer as it did.
<li> Each student should take the quiz at least three times themselves, attempting to get different results. This is to verify that the quiz's mechanisms are functioning. If they are not functioning, students are expected to work with their LLM to debug the quiz (or try to generate the quiz with another LLM).
</ul></details>

## Section 8: Capstone and Reflection
<!-- ~82-165 min -->
<details><summary>Present quizzes and take each other's</summary><ul>
  <li> <i>(5-10 min)</i> Have each student briefly present their quiz. Just a screen showing a title, very brief description, and maybe an image.
  <li> <i>(20 min)</i> Allow students to do each other's quizzes. Remind students how to host webpages.
  <li> <i>(20 min)</i> Have students discuss what they liked about each other's quizzes.
</ul></details>
<details><summary>Review the entire class, considering what was most fun, surprising, or persuasive</summary><ul>
<li> <i>(5-30 min)</i> Show how to host all webpages from class online in a portfolio format, so that work products can be shared with people who might be interested in this class, or in the student's work. Prepare how to do this before class starts, since modern tools can change quickly, and technical difficulties can easily derail plans.
<li> <i>(5-20 min)</i> Was making webpages fun in this class? How about creating images? Did you enjoy expressing your self with words and graphics? Did you enjoy brainstorming new products? Something else?
</ul></details>
<details><summary>Learn about hidden costs of modern technology (eg: coltan mining, energy costs)</summary><ul>
<li> <i>(5 min)</i> Discuss LLMs as a possible vehicle for unethical data mining. "Last class, we discussed that companies like Google and Meta sell profiles about consumers. These profiles are a reputation that everyone creates through their actions online. Companies will buy and sell user data based on these reputations." <br>
"Could engagement with LLMs produce any similar value for LLM companies? Who would want to know details about how you interact with an LLM?"
<li> <i>(10-20 min)</i> Discuss other social and ethical tradeoffs that are being made to support our modern technological world, most of which are hidden from you consumers.<ul>
  <li> A 5 to 10 thousand word chat session with an LLM will use around 45 Watt hours of energy, which is about 20 grams of CO2 emmision from an average power grid. It will take an average healthy and mature tree about 8 hours to pull that much CO2 out of the air. Feel free to validate that using an LLM.
  <li> Estimate with the class how many grams of CO2 was emitted to power their LLM prompts during this class. Ask each student to estimate how many words were in their prompts (or how many prompts they think they did with an estimate of 5 to 10 thousand words exchanged per prompt).
  <li> Ask an LLM: What is Coltan mining, and how is it related to modern technology that people use every day?
  <li> Ask an LLM something like this:<br>"Coltan mining is a moral/ethical/environmental cost of producing the convenience of modern technology. LLMs use a significant amount of electricity to generate sometimes dubious value, which can be generated in similarly tragic ways. These are examples of how technology produces moral and environmental hazards as externalities. This is an ethical trade-off being decided without the consent or even awareness of most consumers. Are there any other notable examples of similar moral/ethical/environmental tradeoffs where a decision has being made to cause suffering in one part of the world for the benefit of others in another part of the world?"
  <li> Ask the students if they recognize any costs of technology in their own life, beyond these hidden externalities.
  <li> Acknowledge that there are terrible costs for our modern technology.<ul>
    <li> Knowing this, it is normal to feel guilt.
    <li> With this guilt, it is normal to be more critical of your own consumption of technology.
  </ul>
</ul>
<li> <i>(10 min)</i> Do not misunderstand: we want you to use this technology.<ul>
  <li> Ask the students if they learned anything they could do in this class that they didn't know before the class started.
  <li> It should be evident that this technology is capable of amazing results that humanity is only just beginning to tap into. It can save time, supercharge creativity, and with that extra time and creative value, we can iterate on our unique values to do better work.
  <li> When you use this technolgy, ask yourself if what you are doing is worth the costs. Make choices that are worth the costs. You should be practiced and skilled with this technology. You should avoid being wasteful with it.
</ul>
</ul></details>
<details><summary>Reflect: What tradeoffs come with AI? How should we use it wisely?</summary><ul>
<li> <i>(2-20 min)</i> What did you learn in this class that you want to remember, and practice in the future? Could we codify ideas like this into a list of best practices?
</ul></details>
<details><summary><b>Assignment (in-class):</b> Write your "Top 5 Habits to Practice When Working With AI."</summary><ul>
<li> Are there any good questions you should ask yourself before asking an LLM?
<li> Are there any tools you prefer for different purposes?
<li> Have you learned your own patterns of thinking or acting that help produce better or worse products?
</ul></details>
