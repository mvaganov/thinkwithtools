# Think With Tools: Augmenting Intelligence, Not Offloading It

> **Tagline:** *Learn to code webpages with AI as your partner--sharpening your mind, not offloading it.*

This course is about learning how to use Large Language Models (LLMs), not as a crutch, but as a partner in your own thinking. You'll build real webpages by hand, experiment with AI-generated code and design, and most importantly, practice the habits that help you stay in control of your ideas, goals, and creativity.  

In this course, you'll start with the basics of HTML and CSS, then move into projects where AI helps you brainstorm, compare, and refine ideas. You'll make a webpage about yourself, design a landing page for a product that doesn't exist, build a site reviewing AI tools, write a clear "how to" wiki, design an infographic, and finish with an interactive quiz. Along the way, you'll learn to ask better questions, critique what AI gives you, and spot when persuasion or manipulation is at work.

The class ends by stepping back to look at the bigger picture: the costs, tradeoffs, and ethics of our modern tech world. By the end, you'll have not just technical skills, but also a personal philosophy for how you want to use AI--so that it makes you sharper, not softer.

## Course Skills
<details>
  <summary><b>Mental Habits:</b> metacognition, design thinking, skepticism, grit</summary><ul>
  <li> Metacognition: Do I understand the problem? What did I think I was asking the AI for? What do I think the AI thought I asked for? Is there something I need more clarity about to form a better question or better instruction?
  <li> Design Thinking: What are the goals to achieve? Can those goals be separated into other goals? What is the most important goal? How can I test if the goals are good? What can I try to achieve those goals? How can I test if our approach is good?
  <li> Skepticism & Critical Thinking: Is the AI telling me the truth? How can I test if it is true? Could my prompt be improved to make the AI more rigorous? Does this even make sense for me to ask? Does this make sense for me to do? Is the AI's suggestion actually good?
  <li> Grit: Is progress being made toward my goal? Is there a small goal I can achieve next? Can I adjust the goal to be more engaging? Can I adjust the webpage to be more engaging?</ul>
</details>
<details><summary><b>Prompt Engineering:</b> goal setting, intentional language, tool literacy, boundary setting</summary><ul>
  <li> Strong goal setting: What kinds of goals is the AI good at understanding? How can I identify a clear goal for the AI model? Does it help to identify what is not a goal? How can I use the AI tool to help me understand my own goal?
  <li> Intentional Language Use: What is the purpose I'm trying to convey? What do the individual words mean? How can I use the model to help refine the prompt?
  <li> Tool Literacy: What are the AI models? What can the models do? How do we use the models well? Are there non-LLM tools I can use to improve AI output?
  <li> Boundary Setting: What is not OK to ask the AI (because everything is being recorded)?</ul>
</details>
<details><summary><b>Iteration:</b> understanding technology, editing/creating artifacts, debugging</summary><ul>
  <li>Understanding Technology: What does this HTML code do? What is possible for HTML to do? How is HTML different from CSS, or JavaScript? How do I make a webpage on the internet? What is the internet?
  <li> Editing/Creating Artifacts: Can I edit HTML code, images, and other artifacts using non-AI tools? What tools can I use? How do I do that? Can AI help me learn to use the tools better?
  <li> Debugging: What is the problem? How do I solve it? How can I learn how to solve it? How can I understand the problem more clearly?
</ul></details>
<details><summary><b>Messaging:</b> persuasion, resilience against manipulation</summary><ul>
  <li> Pursuasion: What do I care about? What do other people care about? How can I make someone care about something? Where can I learn more about persuasive messaging?

## Major Assignments
<details><summary>Build webpages with AI by using metacognitively rich prompts. Use the critical literacy of Computer Programming to edit, critique, and improve AI output.</summary><ul>
For each assignment:<br><ul>
<li>Preparation, before interacting with your AI:<ol>
  <li> Identify your general goal for the assignment. Think about how you want to fulfill the requirements.
  <li> Write a prompt that you think will generate what you want. Save this prompt, we will try it later.
  <li> Write down, in your own words, what you think this assignment is really asking for.
  <li> Write a your personal goal in doing this assignment if you have any, besides just fulfilling assignment requirements.
  <li> Write down at least 3 questions you have about this assigment. For example:<ul>
    <li> Do you know how to create the best picture possible to express your ideas? If not, ask about a good approach for selecting a picture.
    <li> Do you know the latest news about your topic? If not, ask if there is any important recent news about it.
    <li> Do you want an educated opinion about something related to your topic? If so, ask what you want the opinoin about.
    <li> Do you know if a similar webpage already exists that you can be inspired by? If not, ask if there is such a page.
    <li> Do you want to know an interesting factoid about a topic? If so, ask for an interesting factoid about a specific topic.
    <li> Do you know what it is about your topic that is most interesting or important to most people? If you don't, ask what is the most important or interesting thing about the topic.
    <li> Do you know the best way to express a specific message you want to share? If not, write your message and ask for alternative wording.
    <li> ... you can ask an LLM to provide more example questions.
  </ul>
  <li> Draw an outline of the page you want. Use a physical paper with a pen or pencil to sketch boxes for each area of your webpage, and label what each box is for. Take a digital picture of this sketch, with a cell phone or laptop webcam.
</ol>
<li> Once you have done the 6 Preparation steps:<ul>
  <li> Imagine what you expect the AI to do.<ul>
    <li> What kind of thing will it say?
    <li> What questions will it answer?
    <li> Will it seemingly ignore any part of your prompt?
  </ul>
  <li> Give the AI your prompt from step 2. Evaluate it (Is it good? Does it do everything you want?)
  <li> In a new AI window, give the background information from step 3, your own goal from step 4, and the questions you wrote for step 5. Also, take the picture of your outline from step 6 and feed that image into the LLM. After providing all of the previous input, give it your prompt from step 2 (or a modified version of that prompt if it seems appropriate). Evaluate the output.
  <li> Compare the output from the first prompt that didn't contain any of your other thoughts or goals to the second prompt that did. was the different output worth the extra effort?
</ul>
<li> Be prepared to share the LLM's webpage results with the class during the next class meeting.
<li> Edit the generated HTML or CSS to tweak the results. Feel free to ask the LLM to make the changes for you, or for syntax help so you can change things yourself.

<li> TODO Show how to host all webpages from class online, so that work products can be shared with people who might be interested in this class.
</ul></details>
<details><summary>Learn about hidden costs of modern technology (eg: coltan mining, energy costs)</summary><ul>
  <li> Last class, we discussed that companies like Google and Meta sell profiles about consumers. these profiles are an implicit reputation that everyone creates through their actions online.
  <li> Could engagement with LLMs produce any similar value for LLM companies? Who would want to know details about how you interact with an LLM?
  <li> There are many social and ethical tradeoffs that are being made to support our modern technological world, most of them are hidden from you.<ul>
    <li> A 5 to 10 thousand word chat session with an LLM will use 45ish Watt hours of energy, which is about 20 grams of CO2 emmision from an average power grid. It will take an average healthy and mature tree about 8 hours to pull that much CO2 out of the air. Feel free to validate that using an LLM
    <li> Ask an LLM: What is Coltan mining, and how is it related to modern technology that people use every day?
    <li> Ask an LLM something like this:
    "Coltan mining is a cost of producing the convenience of modern technology-infused life enjoyed by western societies. as a side effect, it produces moral and environmental hazards as externalities, which are absorbed by people living in other countries. This is an ethical trade-off that is being decided without the consent or even awareness of most consumers. Are there any other notable examples of similar moral/ethical/environmental tradeoffs where a decision is being made to cause suffering in one part of the world for the benefit of others in another part of the world? When listing these out, please prioritize such tradeoffs that are related to Artificial Intelligence and social media, and it's accessibility to children in the developed world."
  </ul>
  <li> Acknowledge that there are terrible costs for our modern technology.<ul>
    <li> Knowing this, it is normal to feel guilt.
    <li> With this guilt, it is normal to be more critical of your own consumption of technology.
  </ul>
  <li> Do not misunderstand: we want you to use this technology.<ul>
    <li> This technology is capable of amazing results that humanity is only just beginning to tap into.
    <li> When you use this technolgy, ask yourself if what you are doing is worth the costs.
    <li> You should be practiced and skilled with this technology. You should avoid being wasteful with it.
  </ul>
</ul></details>
<details><summary>Reflect: What tradeoffs come with AI? How should we use it wisely?</summary><ul>
<li> What did you learn in this class that you want to remember, and practice in the future?
</ul></details>
